# GUI Message Encryption Program

This is an old project from the summer of 2014 that i made during a summer programming camp at Vassar College. The user inputs a message they would like to encrypt and the program encrypts it. The message can then be decrypted via the same program. There are many features such as copy and paste, saving as a test file, and few other fun hidden features.
