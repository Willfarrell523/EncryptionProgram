# GUI Message Encryption Program

This is an old project from the summer of 2014 that i made during a summer programming camp at Vassar College. The user inputs a message they would like to encrypt and the program encrypts it. The message can then be decrypted via the same program. There are many features such as a login system with registration, copy and paste, saving as a test file, and few other fun hidden features. 

A jar is included in the repo which you can download and run the program if you wish.
